# KiScript

ECMAScript, kept simple.

## Specification

Based on ECMAScript 5.0, with reference to ECMAScript 6.0, and some customization.

## Grammar Variation

- UTF-8 instead of UTF-16.
- No `Keyword` as `IdentifierName`.
- No `.1` or `1.`.
- No automatic semicolon insertion, so no restriction on no line terminator.
- No `in`.
- For each for `iterable` with `for ( : )`.
